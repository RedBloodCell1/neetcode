# GRINDING NEETCODE

I just realize i dont have any readme file here. So yeah i made one for this.

## Day ? (Lets call it day 1):

- So here i will go for linked list. Doing "Reorder Linked List"
- HOLY.... I DID TRAPPING RAIN WATER (HARD) QUESTION BY MYSELF. IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF.
- I look at his solution and damn, what am i even doing XDDDDDDDDDDD. but at least i manage to find a solution by myself and im really proud of it. See you tomorrow. Thats 1 hard question down.

## Day 2:

- I solve 1 medium question on leetcode, and attempt 1 medium question which i know how to do but still cant implement it because of some unclear logic

## Day 3:

- I solve "Copy Linked List with Random Pointer". Well rather than solving i could say that i learned the solution. now i know, or you could say i understand more about node. so when i make a new node and insert the value. Node is literally, im making a _NEW ADDRESS_ with a value inside of it, it doesnt matter the value inside, but the thing is, i make a new address. Thats really cool. I also learned that i can put an address as a key and value inside of a hashmap, thats really cool. I guess i can put an address to a list or set or tuple too xdd. thats cool. Learned so much just with this one problem.
- Okay, i solve a lot of linked list problem. it is safe to say that I _DEEPEN_ MY UNDERSTANDING OF _Lily_. oh btw Lily is a cute name for linked list right, so i will call it Lily from now on. Well i really understand how linked list really work now, like its fundamental. Im sure that i know it 99.9% or if not 100%.
- I always teach my friend so they understand the fundamental, meanwhile i always teach myself from youtube videos or from doing problem. I really really really really wish that I have a teacher that can teach me everyday about this thing WHOLEHEARTEDLY.
- This is me talking to myself like somekind of a diary. I always wanted a teacher like myself. I want me to teach myself. I want to have that person in my life. As of now, Im kinda sad because i have no one like that, or I have one. Its my little brother (14 years old). He is better than me at DSA right now because he study everyday. I changed probably like 5 person's future when i talk to them. I tell them about having a good mindset about learning and studying. I tell them to do dopamine detox and other things to change or strengthen their mindset about this.
- This person im talking about includes: (Not real name, just some familiar name for myself)

1. My little brother (14 years old)
2. My friend (GameOver)
3. My friend (Birly)
4. My minecraft friend (ZofiaMaster)
5. My college friend (Sake)
6. Soon, my other little brother (19 years old)

- I talk to them for hours so they can be a better person. I really wish i have someone that can tell me this things. because I really wish i have a teacher like me that can teach me an even better mindset or new knowledge. Well that is it for today, I am so happy that i reach the point where learning feels so fun everyday because i really enjoy it. I will continue to gain knowledge so i can be a more valuable person. I PROMISE MYSELF. IN 9 MONTHS, I WILL HAVE MY OWN PROJECT EVEN IF ITS SMALL. MARK MY WORD. I already plan on how long i will be doing DSA and what will i do after that. Stay tune on my life update, Well no one is really reading this, even my own friend and brother xdd. So it doesn't really matter i guess. This is just for myself. Maybe when i read this again one day, i will know that i have reached a greater heights and be grateful of myself in the past.
- See you tomorrow~ I really love my family, friends, and myself. I will do my absolute best to be a better person everyday.
- Oh btw, i detoxed for 1 months 10 days now, no games, anime, manga, manhwa, reels, shorts, anything that i feel useless to the progress of my life. Just telling, to see how long will i go without that kind of things xdd. I have fun studying. Its 2 am now. and i am still studying, cant believe i stay up really late for this xddd. See you guys again (Idk who you guys is). This time for real...
