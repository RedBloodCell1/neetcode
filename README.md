# GRINDING NEETCODE

I just realize i dont have any readme file here. So yeah i made one for this.

## Day ? (Lets call it day 1):

- So here i will go for linked list. Doing "Reorder Linked List"
- HOLY.... I DID TRAPPING RAIN WATER (HARD) QUESTION BY MYSELF. IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF.
- I look at his solution and damn, what am i even doing XDDDDDDDDDDD. but at least i manage to find a solution by myself and im really proud of it. See you tomorrow. Thats 1 hard question down.

## Day 2:

- I solve 1 medium question on leetcode, and attempt 1 medium question which i know how to do but still cant implement it because of some unclear logic

## Day 3:

- I solve "Copy Linked List with Random Pointer". Well rather than solving i could say that i learned the solution. now i know, or you could say i understand more about node. so when i make a new node and insert the value. Node is literally, im making a _NEW ADDRESS_ with a value inside of it, it doesnt matter the value inside, but the thing is, i make a new address. Thats really cool. I also learned that i can put an address as a key and value inside of a hashmap, thats really cool. I guess i can put an address to a list or set or tuple too xdd. thats cool. Learned so much just with this one problem.
- Okay, i solve a lot of linked list problem. it is safe to say that I _DEEPEN_ MY UNDERSTANDING OF _Lily_. oh btw Lily is a cute name for linked list right, so i will call it Lily from now on. Well i really understand how linked list really work now, like its fundamental. Im sure that i know it 99.9% or if not 100%.
- I always teach my friend so they understand the fundamental, meanwhile i always teach myself from youtube videos or from doing problem. I really really really really wish that I have a teacher that can teach me everyday about this thing WHOLEHEARTEDLY.
- This is me talking to myself like somekind of a diary. I always wanted a teacher like myself. I want me to teach myself. I want to have that person in my life. As of now, Im kinda sad because i have no one like that, or I have one. Its my little brother (14 years old). He is better than me at DSA right now because he study everyday. I changed probably like 5 person's future when i talk to them. I tell them about having a good mindset about learning and studying. I tell them to do dopamine detox and other things to change or strengthen their mindset about this.
- This person im talking about includes: (Not real name, just some familiar name for myself)

1. My little brother (14 years old)
2. My friend (GameOver)
3. My friend (Birly)
4. My minecraft friend (ZofiaMaster)
5. My college friend (Sake)
6. Soon, my other little brother (19 years old)

- I talk to them for hours so they can be a better person. I really wish i have someone that can tell me this things. because I really wish i have a teacher like me that can teach me an even better mindset or new knowledge. Well that is it for today, I am so happy that i reach the point where learning feels so fun everyday because i really enjoy it. I will continue to gain knowledge so i can be a more valuable person. I PROMISE MYSELF. IN 9 MONTHS, I WILL HAVE MY OWN PROJECT EVEN IF ITS SMALL. MARK MY WORD. I already plan on how long i will be doing DSA and what will i do after that. Stay tune on my life update, Well no one is really reading this, even my own friend and brother xdd. So it doesn't really matter i guess. This is just for myself. Maybe when i read this again one day, i will know that i have reached a greater heights and be grateful of myself in the past.
- See you tomorrow~ I really love my family, friends, and myself. I will do my absolute best to be a better person everyday.
- Oh btw, i detoxed for 1 months 10 days now, no games, anime, manga, manhwa, reels, shorts, anything that i feel useless to the progress of my life. Just telling, to see how long will i go without that kind of things xdd. I have fun studying. Its 2 am now. and i am still studying, cant believe i stay up really late for this xddd. See you guys again (Idk who you guys is). This time for real...

## Day 4:

- BAD DAY??? 1 HARD QUESTION????

## Day 5:

- Im gonna grind a lot today. I dont wanna lose to my lil bro. He already did 69 question????? meanwhile me here only did 39. Well if i wanna cope, i could say that i got works to do, but nahh. no coping, skill issue. Grindingg
- Oh btw, what i mean by grinding is not grinding question but fundamental, skill, and understanding. I wont skip through anything. I will understand everything thoroughly.
- Took me long enough to understand lru cache. Now i 80% understand it or 100% i guess. I just need to do it
- Holy frick that took so long
- Lets go for tree, i did 1 question already by myself. And yeah pretty simple. But next one, i watched the solution and theres 3 way of doing it. Im gonna go for all 3 of them and understand the nook and cranny of it.
- My brain is toasted. i need to rest. See you tomorrow or later i guess.

## Day 6:

- Lets continue. Tree it is

## Day 7:

- Lets continue. Kibo again, (Kibo is the tree from doraemon if u guys know, so i will call tree kibo. its a cute name)
- Honest and honest, I struggle a bit for this tree, because yeah. RECURSIONNNN. But im chilling, just keep studying. I got big plans for my future, so yeah.
- See you tomorrow. Kibo easy done. So hard e

## Day 8:

- I am busy these days, lots of thing to do in work. I will continue today. I will do one kibo, and review maybe all the question from before. Lets start
- Oh i forgot to mention, even when i got lots of things to do, i still do some leetcode and try to implement merge sort. Well it works and im happy.
- I just learn that BST is the tree that is balanced on left and right, i mean like, the left is always smaller than the root and right is always bigger than the root
- I really feel like wow, Tree is getting not easier but more easy in my brain. I really like how my brain feels like its enhanced and i dont even know how it happen. its really cool. See you tomorrow.

## Day 9:

- I will be attempting 1 hard problem minimum window with characters.
- I learned, hard is not worth my time. See you hard. Hello kibo
- Its been quite a while, I have some event going on so its pretty busy. And im quite busy at work so yeah almost no time to do this. But i will be back soon after my thesis is done. See you guys tomorrow

## Day 10:

- More kibo

## Day 11:

- Going to backtracking
- Done subsets. I also done 1 medium daily leetcode question. Maybe i should combine the leetcode to here too? Yeah i should let me do it.

# Day 12:

- One backtracking done.
- Yesterday (IDK what day, the day on this readme is not the literal day but the day i write this), I finished 1 hard problem by myself. feels so good. On leet code. Oh yeah i already put my leetcode here too, cool right? xdd

# Day 13:

- I did some leetcode yesterday, today im gonna go focus on kibo. Why i skipped to backtracking? Its cause my friend want to study together. Now i realize that its not that efficient. I will not keep focusing on my neetcode until im good. I really like how brain works. Its just cool how you don't understand something and the next day you understand all the things that you don't. Well lets start

- Im very sleepy. Goodnight

# Day 14:

- Continuing Tree, Last tree before hard. THAT IS REALLY HARD. I will continue to backtracking. I will trust my brain and let it handle the rest
- COntinuing backtracking. ITS HARD SO FRICKIN HARD.
